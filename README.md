## How to Pre-Seed Postgres database with Schema and Data at Startup for Development Environment

This repo contains the sample application for [Pre-Seeding Postgres database with Schema and Data at Startup for Development Environment](https://github.com/ajeetraina/todo-preseed-postgres) guide on Docker Docs. This guide will walk you through the process of pre-seeding data using Node.js in a containerised PostgreSQL environment. You will learn how to set up a PostgreSQL container using Docker Desktop and then see how to seed initial data into PostgreSQL using Node.js


Notice: This sample repo is intended to support the guide mentioned above. As such, the application code is purposely kept simple to keep the focus on the guide's content and should not be considered production-ready.

- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: Postgres
- Database Management: PgAdmin

## Project Structure

This project contains the following components:

- **/backend** - This directory contains the server.js that sets up the Express.js server and connects to the PostgreSQL database using the pg library. It also defines the routes for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting todos.
- **/frontend** - The frontend directory contains the React application that handles the user interface and interacts with the backend. It contains a React function component named App. This component is responsible for fetching data from a server and rendering it on the web page.
- **seed.js** - This file is used to seed data into the database.
- **.env.sample** - This file is used to store environment variables, such as database credentials and other sensitive information. It's ignored by Git to prevent exposing sensitive data in your version control system.


## Development

## Prerequisite

- Docker Desktop
- Node (Long Term Support version)



## 1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/ajeetraina/todo-preseed-postgres.git
cd todo-preseed-postgres
```

## 2. Navigate into the project

```
cd todo-preseed-postgres
```

## 3. Setup environmental variables

Copy `.env.sample` to the `.env` file and make the necessary changes:

```
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_DB_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_DB=todo_app
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<add_your_postgres_password>
POSTGRES_PORT=5432

```

## 4. Bring up Postgres and Adminer containers

```
docker compose up -d
```

You can verify the services running on Docker Dashboard.

Open up [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080) to access pgAdmin. 

## Add a New Server

Select "Add New Server" and supply the following credentials:

- Hostname/Address: postgres
- Port: 5432
- Maintenance database: todo_app
- Username: postgres
- Password: <your_postgres_password>

Once you add a new server, you can find the list of tasks by selecting the right database schema and table.

## 3. Run the database seed script:

```
npm run seed
```

Note: To automate the seeding process, we have included it as part of your npm scripts. Here’s an example with npm scripts:

```
"scripts": {
  "seed": "node seed.js"
}
```

That's the reason why you were able to execute `npm run seed` to seed the database.


## Running the full-fledged application

1. Start the backend server

Change directory to `backend/`. Run the following command after renaming the `.env.sample` to the `.env` file and modifying the file with the right password.

```
cd backend/
npm install
node server.js
```

### Result:

```
Server is running on port 5000
```


## Frontend Setup

```
frontend
├── README.md
├── node_modules
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── public
└── src
```


1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:

```
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Start the frontend server:

```
npm start
```


4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the to-do list application.

## Building from the scratch

The project is organized into two primary sections: 
- backend and
- frontend.

## Backend

- `server.js`: The main file for the backend server.
- `db.js`: A file that sets up the PostgreSQL connection pool.
- `seed.js`: A script for seeding data into the database.
- `.env`: A file for storing environment variables, such as database credentials.


## Frontend

- `public`: Contains static assets, such as HTML, CSS, and images.
- `src`: Contains the main source code for the frontend application.
- `App.js`: The main component of the application.
- `index.js`: The entry point for the application.
- `components`: A directory containing reusable components, such as TodoList and TodoItem.
- `services`: A directory containing services for interacting with the backend API.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm start`: Starts the development server for both the backend and frontend.
- `npm run seed`: Seeds data into the database.
- `npm test`: Runs tests for both the backend and frontend.
